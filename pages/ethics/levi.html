<h1>Levi's Ethical Reflections</h1>

<p>The ethics of digital devices and platforms by schools needs to be examined and consideration given to both risks and benefits. Especially for internet-connected devices, schools need to have plans in place to manage these risks. At the minimum, schools should have some form of web blocking in place to block harmful websites and apps. The most important categories to block should include malware and explicit content. During class times, it may also be helpful to block apps which distract from learning such as social media and games. However, it is also important for schools to recognise the importance of internet access for students. Schools need to respect that not all students have internet access at home, and therefore may only be able to access it during school hours. Making restrictions too tight or monitoring internet usage too heavily could further widen the digital divide. While it may be tempting to make blocking very strict, it risks filtering out legitimate content especially in topics that may be sensitive such as mental health and sexuality. And while monitoring student’s internet activity may help identify students that are distracted, it can also reveal personal information that students might prefer to keep private. Schools need to walk a line between these interests and consistently assess if the work they are doing is minimising harm effectively. Schools also need to carefully choose the online platforms they decide to use to facilitate learning. As the use of these platforms is essentially imposed on students, it is the school’s responsiblity to ensure that it information is kept private and secure. Strong policies around platform use and how student data is shared with private companies need to be in place and clearly communicated to both students and parents. This would fall in line with the IT Professionals New Zealand Code of Ethics, which includes informed consent. Equitable access to internet and devices needs to be in place for students to ensure that everyone is able to access and complete coursework. This responsibility may fall on government who need to recognise the growing reliance of schools on digital technology and make sure that home internet and device access is accessible to all students.</p>
