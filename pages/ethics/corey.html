<h1>Corey's Ethical Reflections</h1>

<p>It is clear from the data presented in this project that devices and internet connectivity are already deeply ingrained into the education sector however there is a significant amount of uncertainty. Our research failed to provide any concrete answers around accountability, especially around BYOD, and instead highlighted a lack of consensus. Regarding educational outcomes, it seems that devices can have a multitude of positive effects if handled correctly, but if mismanaged have the potential to be detrimental. What is certain is that there is a target painted on educations back and a severe shortfall of trained cybersecurity professionals. I believe that further discourse is seriously needed to address the many concerns surrounding this issue. I find the fact that our research opened up more questions than it answered concerning and I believe that stumbling blindly into the unknown is dangerous. As a society we need to clearly define a set of moral questions surrounding cybersecurity in education and attempt to quantify them in order monitor outcomes so that we can provide the best possible future for our current generation of young learners. I believe that there should be a regulated government mandate implementing a standard for a minimum required level of training in cybersecurity and safe web practices for all educational staff, so that we can be confident that teachers are well equipped to guide our youth into world wide web. Moreover, given that connectivity is so ubiquitous with modern living, cybersecurity and safe web practices needs to be taught as a foundational part of the curriculum. </p>
