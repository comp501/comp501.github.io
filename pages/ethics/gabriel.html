<h1>Gabriel's Ethical Reflections</h1>

<p>It is important to consider the ethical implications of the choices, risks, and opportunities that remote learning and the implementation of digital platforms have in the educational system. Results that we have encountered surrounding this issue have shown that remote learning in New Zealand schools has increased, especially during the pandemic. Data has shown that sustaining this through monitoring, upgrading, and securing is integral for the future benefit of education. Opportunities that technology presents in schools prepare students for later jobs, apply a wider base of knowledge to access, direct access from any device to resources, and more. It positively impacts students’ overall engagement, teachers’ tools, and teaching techniques. Therefore, increasing overall success in schools.</p>

<p>However, with the merits of technology in the educational system, online threats may occur hindering the way students and teachers access these platforms. Cyber security threats such as malware, malicious websites, zoom bombing, pornography, and harmful digital content exist on the internet. Managing online security is essential in schools, as most schools adhere to blocking certain websites that may be accessed that are not school-related. E.g., Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.  Furthermore, restricting such websites must be done in a balanced manner to allow students to still be able to access, communicate with others whilst staying on track with studies. An effective monitoring system on data, educational platforms must be prioritized in schools to ensure that there is enough safety on students’ data and the platforms, students use to communicate.</p>

<p> Cyber security measures are essential for education providers to implement to reduce the amount of risk of malicious activity. In terms of internet access, schools must implement a secure ISP that protects the data and platforms that students and teacher’s access. Schools must consider secure providers to block out website requests, malicious spam emails, and incorrect usage of the internet. An example is zoom bombing that may occur, which consists of unauthorized access from other sources that may interrupt learning environments.  It is the school’s responsibility to create policies surrounding this to ensure a safe environment for students to access information.  Lastly, the quality of cyber security practices must be understood by New Zealand schools. Thus, increasing the safety surrounding this issue.</p>
