<h1>Risks</h1>

<p>
  There is no doubt- the digital age is upon us. As digitisation, devices, and tech work their way into the very fabric of modern society, it seems inevitable that the education sector should also become saturated in technology and devices. According to a report on Digital Devices and Student Outcomes in New Zealand Schools by the Ministry of Education (Ministry of Education, 2018), 80% of students surveyed currently have access to, and use, internet connected school computers during class hours. This saturation of technology in our education system does however carry significant risks and raises the need for a number of conversations to had on the topic.

<h2>Internal Risks</h2>
<p>
  Perhaps the biggest risk comes from the students themselves. With only 3% of student respondents claiming they don’t have access to internet connected computers at school (Ministry of Education, 2018) it is clear that, whether we like it or not, students are currently connected to the web during the school day. This raises the potential for an entire demographic of young, inexperienced web users to wander blindly into an unknown world of malicious activity, cyber-attackers, and security threats. The questions raised here are, ‘How competent are young students at browsing the web safely?’, ‘How well are net safety and safe browsing practices being taught to young students?’, ‘How vulnerable are online activities at schools to malicious attacks?’. ‘Network for Learning’, a crown company that provides connectivity solutions and cybersecurity for over 2400 schools in New Zealand published a report earlier this year detailing the security threats they have come across in New Zealand schools. (Network for Learning, 2021), <i>Cyber security threats continue to rise - they’re up 17% from the first half of the year. There are 2.3 million online security threats blocked every day, or 1,592 each minute. </i>This data clearly highlights the severity of risk involved with connectivity in the classroom. The threats listed in the report detail daily blocking of anonymisers, malware, phishing, and other malicious software designed to infect devices and steal information. Aside from bocking attacks from the outside, (N4L, 2021) also details blocking internal threats such as misuse of school resources for access to games, social media etc, as well as more serious internal issues such as attempted access of pornography, gambling and using school computers to undertake in cyberbullying behaviours. ‘Network for Learning’ purportedly blocks 87,000,000 – 134,000,000 actions per school term in New Zealand.

<h2>Teachers and Staff</h2>
<p>
  Students certainly pose a potential cybersecurity risk in New Zealand schools; however, it would be counterproductive to assume they are the only danger. Many threats and hazardous web behaviours come from the teachers and staff members themselves. To quote (Ministry of Education, 2018):<i> only one in ten students used devices without teachers also using them. </i>Clearly there is an imperative for emphasis to exist around safe online practices for educational staff, particularly the older generation. While it is true in many cases that age brings with it knowledge and experience, when it comes to tech, age has the potential to bring with it a lack of exposure and a sense of novelty.

<h2>BYOD</h2>
<p>
  Not all threats come from within the school grounds. BYOD, or ‘Bring Your Own Device’ opens up the potential for compromised devices to be brought in from the outside and connected to school networks. This avenue opens up wider social discussion around who should be responsible for providing electronic devices to children when they are required for schoolwork, and who should be responsible for ensuring these devices don’t become compromised. It would seem that there is no clear answer for who should be held accountable if a BYOD comes under attack, (Education Solutions, n.d.) suggests that schools are aiming for an “all care, no responsibility” policy. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has exasperated the problems surrounding BYOD. (Manakau Institute of Technology, n.d.):<i> According to a Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) lecturer, Dr Sreenivas Tirumala, the country’s school system is another area of potential vulnerability with the move to distance learning forced by COVID-19 lockdowns, as well as the growth of BYOD contributing to a forty percent increase in security breaches in the last twelve months.</i>

<h2>A Targeted Industry</h2>
  <p>
    Why are there so many threats and attacks aimed at schools? (M.I.T, n.d.): <i>The nation’s more than two thousand five hundred schools hold large amounts of data including student information, staff employment records, financial statements and assessment materials. While most have an IT support person who takes care of hardware, network and software, it’s highly likely that they do not have adequate skills in cybersecurity to protect this highly sensitive data.</i> It is because of these reasons that the education sector is seen by attackers as an opportune target. The wealth of confidential information held in school’s databases acts as a giant target painted on their backs, and the perception held by those involved in ICT is that they are an easy target compared to other industries and that schools lack adequate cybersecurity protections. (Bushell-Embling, 2018) shows that in Australia, the education sector was the most targeted industry according to 2017 reports by Dimension Data and NTT Security. The article points to the broad range of devices and access points in universities and schools, and the fact that student records and other personally identifiable information are of great value to cybercriminals. All of this serves to highlight a need for highly skilled, trained and competent cybersecurity analysts to work with the education sector in the battle against malicious activity; a need that we, as New Zealanders, cannot currently fulfil. According to Careers NZ (Careers NZ, n.d.) the need for security analysts is continuing to increase and there are not enough trainees or juniors currently in training to meet future demand, let alone current demand. Because of this, ICT security specialist are listed on Immigration NZ’s long term skill shortage list and the Government is actively searching for overseas security analysts to emigrate into the country. Despite these efforts, the demand continues to grow.
