<h1>Choices</h1>

<p>This section will cover the choices schools and other education providers need to make when it comes to cybersecurity. There is a wide landscape of software and hardware solutions available, so each need to be judged based on their merits and potential risks.</p>

<h2>Web blocking</h2>

<p>Many schools in New Zealand use ISP-level blocking to protect students from harmful or distracting content. A popular provider of school internet is Network for Learning which uses a combination of DNS blocking and packet inspection to block millions of website requests daily across a wide range of categories. The most frequently blocked categories include file sharing/storage, games, software downloads, and social networking/messaging (Network for Learning: Data & Insights Report, 2021). Using Network for Learning can be a useful tool for preventing student access of malicious website, but it also poses risks to privacy. As stated on their website and privacy policy, DNS requests are logged and tied to specific users on the network. This allows schools to view website requests by student including those that were blocked. DNS requests have been shown to be sensitive data, which can reveal information about an individual’s sexual orientation or mental health (Imana et al., 2021). Schools considering Network for Learning need to keep privacy issues in mind and ensure the student body is well informed about the information that is collected and who has access to it.</p>

<h2>Operating systems</h2>

<p>Schools can have a lot of influence on the operating systems used by students, whether these are installed on school-provided machines or those recommended for use on student-owned devices. Therefore, schools must make an informed choice about what which systems to recommend and which ones to avoid. A popular choice is Chrome OS, which has a strict security model that protect it from various potential attacks (Okechukwu, 2014). The operating system relies heavily on the use of web apps, which are sandboxed within the Chrome browser. This means that applications used on Chrome OS do not have direct access to the underlying system, so the potential damage that a malicious program could do is much more limited. Windows and MacOS, on the other hand, give applications a lot more access to the system, so the threat of malicious programs is much greater.</p>

<h2>Learning Management Systems</h2>

<p>There is a huge variety of Learning Management Systems (LMS) out there which schools can use to assign work to students. Examples include Google Classroom, Moodle, Blackboard, Canvas, and more. One of the main differentiating factors between these systems is that some can be self-hosted, while others can only be used on the respective company’s cloud. This is a choice schools will have to make when choosing an LMS. A popular choice for schools is Google Classroom, which integrates with other Google products such as Google Docs (Google for Education, n.d.). This is an example of a vendor-hosted solution, as it can only be used if each user has a Google account and all data is stored on Google’s servers. This can be a cybersecurity advantage as the protection of data is largely outside the hands of the education provider and is managed by Google instead. However, as Google products start taking large portions of market share in New Zealand (Yeo, 2017), it means that Google could gain a huge amount of control over student data. In order for schools to control and secure their own data, they would need to use a self-hosted LMS solution (Berking & Gallagher, 2016, p. 36). These allow schools to install the system on their own hardware, so the responsibility lies on the school to protect it. This eliviates some of the privacy concerns with using a vendor-hosted solution, but may make the system more vulnerable to attack depending on the cybersecurity practices of the school’s IT department.</p>

<h2>Video conferencing solutions</h2>

<p>In response to the pandemic, distance learning using video conferencing has become popular among schools. Because these solutions are used to transmit voice and video of teachers and students, it is critical to ensure that the chosen platform has strong security measures in place. In a comparitive analysis, Singh & Awasthi (2020) various solutions were considered in regards to their security and features. While the conferencing platform Zoom has encountered numerous privacy and security problems, regular updates have provided fixes for many of these. Microsoft Teams boasts strong security features such as antimalware and a quickly growing user base with many schools across the world adopting it. Many similar features are also provided by Google Meet, so it might be a valuable alternative for schools already using Google products. Cisco WebEx Teams is mainly used in corporate settings, but boasts some of the strongest security of the lot, with end-to-end encryption for meetings. However, it is also the only one that is missing a client for Linux operating systems. Finally, GoToMeeting is another paid service that is comparable to Zoom or Google Meet, but with a subscription cost. In summary, all solutions can be configured to have sufficiently strong security. It is important that no matter which solution is chosen, these security features are activated to ensure no unauthorized users gain access to the call and the privacy of participants is ensured.</p>
