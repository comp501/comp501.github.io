<h4>Topic Description:</h4>

<p>
    Digital learning is becoming the dominant source of learning in New Zealand's schools today expanding the amount of resources, collaboration and interaction. An abundance of educational platforms are being used by students & teachers to aid in learning. However, the potential of these platforms being harmed and exploited may expose some safety risks. Exploitation of privacy, data, sensitive information, and cyber attacks have routinely increased. Results have shown that there may be an overconfidence in tools being used by students without security needs. It is important to spread awareness of cyber security on these platforms, and implement safe security infrastructures.
