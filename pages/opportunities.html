<h1>Opportunities</h1>

<p>Technology has been rapidly advancing in today’s age, redefining the way learn, communicate, and develop as humans. Digital technology has played a pivotal role in New Zealand’s education system, fundamentally changing the way we acquire knowledge and gain understanding of the world. This section will cover the benefits of increased technology usage in schools, and why the implementation of tech in schools is helpful towards the learning in education for students and teachers. </p>

<h2>Influence in Educacation</h2>

<p>The increase of technology provided in classrooms across New Zealand has directly influenced students’ education.  In research from Sutcliffe (2021) states, relationships are presented between 15-year-old students' device use at school and their knowledge and skills across reading, mathematics, and science literacy, which sit alongside digital literacy as foundational areas for success and further learning in the modern world. Access to digital learning from students is beneficial in terms of education. Becoming proficient in the way we use technology is important in opening opportunities in the way students learn. Examples of opportunities that technology presents are remote learning and access at home. Another benefit that arises is the direct access to information to aid the students learning. The internet is vast in terms of knowledge that is provided, such as journal articles on any subject, reports, and external resources.  Furthermore, this is easily accessible from a range of devices, including any platforms, cell phones, tablets, etc. </p>

<h2>Benefits in Teaching Techniques</h2>

<p>Similarly, the effective use of technology has affected teachers’ techniques and approach towards teaching their students in class. This facilitates how teachers collaborate with students, using online resources to discuss, deliberate, and network. When implemented effectively, the use of ICT tools can improve the quality of interactions between students and teachers (Newton, 2018). In addition, technology provides a more interactive environment for teachers to work with their students. This includes personally setting targeted goals, applying feedback to students which therefore leads to an increase in personalized learning. It improves relationships between teachers and students. Thus, providing a more productive, and efficient way to learn.  According to studies, the benefits of digital technology for students include increased motivation and engagement, support for independent and personalized learning, greater critical thinking and multiple literacies, access to information resources and expertise, and the possibility of greater opportunities for collaboration (Newton, 2018). This is important as it directly supports learning online, due to the current state of the world suffering from staying at home through the pandemic. </p>

<h2>Integration of devices in the educational system</h2>

<p>The integration of devices has allowed the educational system to prep for the current state of the world, resulting in the effective use of teaching and learning online.  Additionally, it has created opportunities for students who are adjusting to the real world and later into jobs when they leave school. It also teaches students to be independent in their learning. This is through the high quantity of available quality tools. Therefore, disregarding the old style of teacher-centered learning where students are limited to the amount of information that is given to them to learn. Being self-sufficient is an important trait that may be developed for students that transfers to their toolkit, allowing them to be more successful in their field of study.  Indicators of high levels of student engagement included increased: “on task” behavior; concentration and perseverance; willingness to spend out-of-school time on project work; and fewer behavior management problems (McDowall, 2010). This demonstrates the student’s willingness to not restrict themselves to teacher conducted work and go further to gain knowledge.  Hence, illustrating the usage of technology in education is helpful towards a student’s overall success, correlating to higher engagement to tasks. </p>

<h2>Tools and platforms</h2>

<p>Technology influences the educational system positively, providing schools with more tools and platforms to expand in. This directly affects the infrastructure of New Zealand schools and sustaining the demand for technology is integral for future benefit. It is valuable to embrace this change, implementing services such as a safe networking system monitored by the teachers.  Indications are that while most schools are already embracing digital learning, they are keen to upgrade their internal networks through the School Network Upgrade Project to ensure service quality is retained as technology demands increase (Schools Infrastructure Group, 2013).  The majority of schools have embraced the aid of technology which positively affects the user and the economy in New Zealand.  However, it is critical to state the security that is presented when using technology. As students’ data is stored, platforms that they use for learning must be heavily monitored and secured. This is to prevent other sources from tampering with students’ data and ensure a safe environment for students to learn.</p>

<h2>Student data consumption statistics</h2>
<p>
  School data use
  +  Every day, a student typically consumes 268 megabytes (MB) of data.
  +  Data use jumps 32% from the first half of the year, despite an Auckland-wide lockdown in August.
  +  Secondary school students consume 2.5 times more data than primary school students.
  +  Students at smaller schools (<100 students) consume more data than students at larger schools.
  +  Students in the West Coast region use the most data (375 MB each day), with Marlborough      students using the least (158 MB).
  +  Streaming media sites comprise 24% of all data consumed across the Managed Network, with      YouTube, Apple, Netflix, and TikTok being the most popular sites in this category (in that order).
  Browsing time - top 10 websites
  +  School internet users spend the most time on sites owned by Google, Apple and Microsoft.
  +  Collaboration platforms that allow student classwork to be shared with teachers and parents          are among the most popular education websites (Hāpara’s Teacher Dashboard, Seesaw,    and Linc-Ed).
  +  More time is spent using online reading resources than maths (Grammarly, Language Perfect,      Epic).

  <h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, it is important to acknowledge the importance of digital access and learning for our society. The implementation of technology in New Zealand schools presents new knowledge that may be gained from the students and teachers, creating opportunities to learn new skills digitally across the many platforms online. It also positively impacts the student’s overall engagement and enables them to connect to a wider range of content regardless of location.  As a result, digital technologies provide a real time access to tools provided by the teachers, improving feedback for the student.</p>
